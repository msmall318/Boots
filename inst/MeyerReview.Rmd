##Overview

The Boots package is an easy to use Shiny app for forecasting.
  
##Accuracy
The data appear to be accurate in the Shiny app and it is clear how the forecasts were computed.

The data features in the proposal appear to have worked, since the forecast worked and the dataset looks good.
  
##Compilation

There were no problems running or installing the app or package. Everything seemed to update in the app when different selections were made. 
  
##Ease of Use

The package documentation makes it easy to run the app. I was unaware that ETS stood for exponential smoothing, even though I've used exponential smoothing before, so that might be helpful to clarify. The plots look good. Would it be possible to include the comma separators on the y-axis troop numbers? It might also be helpful to add some guidelines for the residual plot tab.
