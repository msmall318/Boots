##Overview

  CPT Small presented a Shiny App geared towards helping analysts
better forecast US Troop "Boots-on-the-Ground" based on 
open source data provided from the Defense Manpower Data Center.
He outlined 9 features that this app should accomplish as part of 
routine use. These features and the analysis of these features
are outlined below:


##Feature Review

* __Forecast__ - This portion of the app is done behind the scenes.
However, when the sliders are moved or a different country/branch of service
is selected, the visible plots do regenerate without any
errors appearing in either the app or the console.

* __Provide Values__ - The plots and report tabs regenerate with
new results when the inputs are changed. Assuming users of the report
are familiar with what the outputs are supposed to be and
what those outputs mean, then the outputs will be useful.
However, for a new user to this type of forecasting, some
of the outputs seem to be missing context to help the
user understand the meaning of the charts. For example,
the residual plots are calculated and presented.

However, no context is provided to help beginner users
understand what these residuals mean or how they should be
incorproated into analysis.

* __Plot Forecasts__ - The forecast plots are recalculated
and presented each time an input updates. The plots match
the output provided in the report tabs, so the plots seem to
be accurate. Again, no errors or warnings appear when the
plots are generated.

* __Order Data__ - This is another feature that is completed
behind the scenes in the App. When comparing the generated
plots to the dataset contained in the "data" folder for 
a few data situations, such as Soldiers in Afghanistan.

The table is presented sequentially
and the plot mirrors the table's output. Therefore, this feature
appears to be working as intended.


 __Convert Data__ - The report outputs on the ARIMA summary
and ETS Summary looks properly formatted relative to what the
regular output should be. Additionally, these outputs match
the plots on the first tab. Therefore, the objects appear to be
calculating appropriately.


 __Group Data__ - Continuing from the previous feature, the
data presented in the plots mirror identically the specific
situations provided above. Therefore, the plots appear to be
generating forecast objects only on the selected groups and
not including other irrelevant information. Therefore, this
function appears to be woring as intended as well.

 __Tidy the Data__ - The dataset provided in the package
comes tidied according to the "Tidyverse" rules. Therefore
this feature is complete. However, it is unclear if this shiny
app will conducts this tidying if new data is presented.

 __Fill Missing Data__ - The dataset provides an imputed
number column. This number on first glance appears to be
a linear imputation from the two most recent encompassing years
(i.e. if 1998 is missing, then that troop data is linearly
imputed from 1997 and 1999). However, as with the previous
feature, while present in the given data set, the ability to provide
new data and confirm that it recalculates new imputed values
is unclear.

 __Assess Accuracy__ - The model outputs are provided
to allow users to identify which model provides the best
response based on the data inputs. This part also exhibits
areas that require expert knowledge to use. Novice or beginner
users will have a difficult time identifying which model
output is better suited for their situation.



##Overall Review

Overall, this app does what the proposal indicates. The app
calculates a forecast object and allows the user to select
which country and which branch of US Service for forecasting.
Additionally, it provides the outputs in easy to read plots
that match across the different tabs. Additionally, the 
output seem correctly calculated relative to what an untrained
eye would expect the outputs to look like. However, this app 
does have a shortcoming of not having immediate use for a
new or beginner user. Users will have to do some external
research to have a useable understanding of what the outputs
are and what they are telling the user.


##Result

__48__ (if no gradation allowed, then __50__) - This app
performs as required. There are no warnings or errors as the
user generates outputs. The inputs are easy to use and
understand what they are changing on the data set. The plots
are easy to read and match across tabs. My only improvement
would be to include a front page that highlights what the app
is supposed to do, and how each tab in the app helps accomplish
that goal. This front page could also explain some of the
finer detailed items like which metric is best used for selecting
a model or explaining the residuals and how the residuals
might impact model selection or outputs. Otherwise, this
app meets the requirements and could be published immediately
to an audience of analysts who are familiar with these model 
types and can use their expertise immediately.
